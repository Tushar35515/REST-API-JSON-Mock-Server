# REST JSON Mock Server

This project is a lightweight REST-based JSON mock server built using Node.js and Express.js. It allows for easy addition, update, deletion, and retrieval of data from a JSON file, simulating the behavior of a real server without the need for a backend database.

## Features

- Supports CRUD operations for multiple entity types (e.g., posts, authors) stored in a JSON file.
- Immutable IDs to ensure data integrity.
- Middleware for handling requests and responses, including JSON parsing, error handling, and request validation.
- Easy setup and configuration.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rest-json-mock-server.git
